## What is Gecko?

Tired of complex setups and bloated GUIs just to run a simple project? **Gecko is your answer.**

Gecko is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that provides you with a complete, portable, and isolated development environment for building websites and web applications. It's built with Golang for peak performance and minimal resource usage, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: **coding.**

It bundles all the essential services you need:
* **Web Server:** Apache (with Pretty URLs out-of-the-box!)
* **Databases:** MySQL & PostgreSQL
* **Language:** Ready for your Go projects and more!
* **And more to come!**

Think of it as the spiritual successor to SWAMP, but rebuilt from the ground up to be faster, more powerful, and way, way cooler.
